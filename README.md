This repository is designed to help beginners learn the C programming language step-by-step through practical examples and exercises. It covers essential topics including syntax, variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions, arrays, strings, pointers, structures, unions, file handling, and mini projects. To get started, you’ll need a C compiler such as **Dev-C++** (an easy-to-use IDE for Windows – [download here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)), **GCC** (available on Linux/macOS via `sudo apt install build-essential`), or **MinGW** (for compiling C/C++ on Windows – [official site](http://www.mingw.org/)). You can write and run C code using a terminal with `gcc filename.c -o output` followed by `./output`, or by using an IDE like Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio Code with the C/C++ extension. The project includes organized folders for each topic and is suitable for students, programming beginners, or anyone who wants to refresh their C knowledge. Contributions are welcome, whether it's adding new examples, improving code, or enhancing documentation.
